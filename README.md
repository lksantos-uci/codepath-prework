## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app. 

Knowing nothing about iOS development, I struggled the most when I had to connect the logic to the button. When I selected the button and pressed Ctrl then dragged on it, I accidentally inserted an outlet rather than action. Also, Ctrl and drag did not work initially, but relaunching Xcode resolved the issue.
